# Hello there!

I'm Andy, a British developer, interested in functional and systems programming,
looking at working in Rust.

## Current Project

I'm currently only working on a single project:

- [test_gen](https://github.com/DunnAnDusted/test_gen) - A comprehensive function-like macro, for concisely defining parameterized tests.

To this extent, I'm looking for further projects to tackle.

## Currently Learning

- CI using GitHub actions
- "CD" thanks to the `cargo publish` command
- Rust skills

Similarly to above, I'm looking for further projects,
to learn and develop my skills further.
